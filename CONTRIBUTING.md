If you want to contribute to the aioimaplib library don't hesitate to make pull requests. 

Here is a checklist to answer before pushing a new PR:

- Are the [automated tests](README.rst) passing ?
- Is the new feature/bugfix you're adding unit tested ?
- Are the commits fine grain splitted with one intent for each commit ?
  - Are my refactorings (rename, dead code, extract method, extract class...) kept separated ?
